The Presentation: 

This week we got to hear from a guest lecturer: Kevin Fleming from Bloomberg, who spoke to us about Open Source work in Bloomberg. I think one of the things I found most interesting about his talk was the fact that as a person who didn't know much about the ecosystem of open source, I found it very interesting that a company like Bloomberg would be so involved in it. Bloomberg is an extremely large corporation, worth billions of dollars, and alongside that, it's also a relatively old corporation as well. You'd think that with a company like that, it really doesn't embody the idea/concept of open source, which revolves around being free, for the people, and agile. However Kevin was able to show us how we can live in a world in which big businesses not only interact with open-source development, but also support them, in a mutually beneficial relationship. I think this fact was both interesting and surprising, because we always think about open-source as extremely hacky, and big businesses as rigid and tight, but a combination between the two leads to reaping rewards that both of the entities can share, and I think the longer we look at this type of relationship, the more it seems like it's something that will become more prevalent in the future as well.

FreeCodeCamp Update:

This week our group managed to finish our PR for adding the solutions to the sorting algorithms in the freeCodeCamp challenges, and now this week we're hoping to finish up our PR that will add our intro to recursion into the challenges, and hopefully to get started on something else for next week as well.
