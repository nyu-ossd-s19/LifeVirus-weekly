Week 2: Learned how to set upstream in git, and how to fix conflicts. I used git in this capacity for my internship at the Department of Records and Information Services 2 years ago, but I forgot everything haha. The class was a great refresher, and git is an excellent tool for collaboration, and devloping, in terms of relegating tasks to individuals, and deciding what each individual is required to accomplish. 

Joannify: Not much change to the extension, did some research on DOM manipulation and what is required to make the extension work, but no actual work being done yet. This project seems like it is in the scope of what is doable, but the scalabilty doesn't seem great. 

Next Week: 
Goals for next week include doing some setup work for Joannify, and figuring out how to set up the github repo for collaboration!
