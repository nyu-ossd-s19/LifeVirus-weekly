Week 14:

This week we started off by learning more about git, and how convoluted branch management could get. Honestly prior to using git in the classes taught here at NYU, I used to hate it as a tool, because it seemed unnecessarily convoluted, and kind of a pain to understand. But after using it more and more, I'm now super appreciative of how useful it is, and how much using it makes it easier for collaboration. I'm really glad I'm learning more and more about it because not only is it a useful tool to have in my arsenal as a programmer, but honestly it also is interesting to learn about in general.

FreeCodeCamp:

Overall, we haven't done much this week, since we were preparing for the presentation. That aside, we also are still working on the pull request to get the intro to recursion up, so that's what we're going to be focusing on this week. I'm hoping that we can get one or two more pr's in before the semester is over!
