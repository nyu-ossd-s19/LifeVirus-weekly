The project I chose to evaluate is UBlock Origin, which is a tool that I'm sure many of us use to avoid those pesky advertisements/protect ourselves from malicious websites. I picked this project because I was surprised to find out that it was an open source project, considering that it was something that I have used for a while, and I thought it would be interesting to see how it worked, and to contribute to a project that I had used for a while. Furthermore, since most of the code base is in JavaScript, I thought it would be a good opportunity to try and better my JavaScript skills too. However, looking at the contributions, and evaluating the project, it seems like it's relatively difficult for new contributors to contribute in a meaningful way, and small contributions seem difficult to make, while most of the underlying codebase hasn't been changed in years. :( I am still happy that I was able to do this evaluation, because it taught me a lot about how contributions and development has been like for the last few years for this project, and although it doesn't seem like something that I can dip my toes in, it helps to know that there exists projects like this which I have used for years without knowing all the hard, open-source work that had gone into it to allow me to do so.
