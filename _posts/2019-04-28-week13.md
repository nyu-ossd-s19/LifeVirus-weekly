Contributions to freeCodeCamp Week 13: 

This week freeCodeCamp got to submit two pull requests we've been working on for a while, the first being adding solutions to the sorting algorithms coding challenges, which we did for quicksort, mergesort, insertion sort, bubble sort, and selection sort. The second PR we made this week was the creation of the introduction to recursion course on freeCodeCamp. If this PR gets merged, I think it would be pretty cool to be the first to break ground on the site on a topic as ubiquitous and important as recursion. Although the semester is quickly coming to a close, I think that we've done some pretty good work so far, and that working on these open source projects is actually pretty amazing! I've never really been able to write code that I've felt was actually meaningful, and the feeling is pretty addicting. I'm sure that even after this class is over, I'll probably be dipping my toes into open source more and more... I'm grateful for what I've learned in this short span of time. As for closing out the semester, I'm really hoping we can get a few more PR in, either expanding on the recursion, which we created, or doing something new. Fingers crossed!
