This week we finally got to show off Joannify in class, and it was really amazing to see what the other groups managed to do with their extensions. Joannify was a fun idea, but our group didn't really have the javascript knowledge to create anything of substance :(. It was pretty amazing to see how talented some people in the class were, some extensions made me want to download and use them myself!

In terms of my experience working with a team to develop Joannify, I feel what we most learned about was the importance of collaboration. No members of our team had worked much before with github, in terms of collaboration, so we had difficulty figuring out how to work efficiently and properly. Most of our communication was in person, and we had a hard time trying to work remotely on the repository. I enjoyed working with my team members, and learning about cooperating together. I wish we were more experienced, and that we could've perhaps made an extension that would be useful and something that we could put on the Mozilla Store, but Joannify was a fun idea, and it was our idea. I feel that although our extension may be not as impressive as others out there, we possibly learned the most when it comes to open source software development, and I have no doubts that these are skills that are going to help us later on in the future.
