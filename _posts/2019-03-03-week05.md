title: Week 5
---

For week 5, we are analyzing the licenses of the projects that we are interested in working on, and for this week, I have chosen to pivot to a different project than what I researched last week, because uBlock Origin (the project I was originally interested in), after studying the repository, I discovered that much of what they are working on currently is mostly porting to other browsers/updating to keep the extension working with current versions/translating, and that the primary codebase for the files that make up uBlock have not been changed for almost two years now. I want to work on something that is still changing and updating so that I can make contributions directly to the product as opposed to just translation/ports. 

After looking through the other evaluations that my classmates have done, I surprisingly found that another product which I had used often in my day to day was also an open source project: Habitica, a video-game themed planner/task manager https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica After looking through the codebase, I discovered that most of the code is in JavaScript, which is what I had wanted to work on, and looking through the repository, it seems like something which I would be interested in working on. 

License: The license used by Habitica is the GPL v3 License, which means that, the software is free to use for any purpose, that the user is free to change the software to suit their needs, to share the software with their friends/neighbors, and have freedom to share the changes they made (according to https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html ). This is what GNU calls "copyleft software", which is "We call this copyleft: the software is copyrighted, but instead of using those rights to restrict users like proprietary software does, we use them to ensure that every user has freedom." - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html

I also found this helpful/easy to read image on tldrlegal.com that quickly shows what you can and cannot do with the GNU GPLv3 license:

Installing the dev-environment: I followed the instructions on https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Setting_up_Habitica_Locally , which detail how to install the dev environment on my local machine, and I used a Vagrant machine on my mac. The instructions are very clearly written in a wiki maintained by the Habitica devs, and I had no issues with getting it to work on my machine!
