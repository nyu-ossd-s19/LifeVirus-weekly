found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others

__Project website:__
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock (No central website, ublock.org is separate, not associated.)


__What is the purpose of the project:__

"An efficient blocker add-on for various browsers. Fast, potent, and lean.

uBlock Origin is NOT an "ad blocker": it is a wide-spectrum blocker -- which happens to be able to function as a mere "ad blocker". The default behavior of uBlock Origin when newly installed is to block ads, trackers and malware sites -- through EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Peter Loweâ€™s ad/tracking/malware servers, various lists of malware sites, and uBlock Origin's own filter lists." - https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__

Relatively difficult, there is a contributing.md document on the github, but its only a few lines telling users to post issues on the github.
